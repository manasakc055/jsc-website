The long-term capital gain is computed by deducting the indexed cost of acquisition and indexed cost of improvement.The concept of indexation was introduced as the value of a rupee keeps changing due to inflation. If it is fair to pay more for a toothpaste over the years, it is fair to pay capital gain tax with incorporating the effect of inflation on your purchase. Indexation lets you show a higher purchase cost of the capital asset that you bought, this helps lower your overall profit.The acquisition price is indexed by a factor called the Cost Inflation Index (CII).CII is the CII for year in which the asset is transferred divided by the year in which the asset was acquired. The CII is then multiplied with the purchase price to arrive at the indexed acquisition cost. The cost inflation index for the current year 2015-2016 is 1081."
