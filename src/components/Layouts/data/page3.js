The Parliament passed the bill on 6th May, 2015, after it received 352 votes for and 37 against it.",
            "description-2":"GST is a kind of indirect tax. Currently, Indian consumers have to pay indirect tax on goods and services such as Value Added Tax, Service Tax, Excise Duty, Customs Duty, etc. Under the current system, each State has a right to levy their own tax on the goods coming into their dominion for sale and consumption, while the Centre levies taxes on manufacture of the goods.

If the dyes for the dress are bought from Madhya Pradesh, then the manufacturer has to pay the state taxes applicable for the dyes in Madhya Pradesh while buying it, and also pay Gujarat’s “import duty” on the product. Similarly, if the buttons for the dress are bought from Rajasthan, then another set of taxes are added to the manufacturing cost. At the end of this chain, when the product reaches the market for sale, VAT is added to it. So all the taxes paid for the production of the dress so far gets added to the cost of the dress, which rises considerably from its actual manufacturing cost.",

All the sundry taxes will be clubbed into just 2 levels – Central GST and State GST. What a trader will essentially be able to do is claim a refund on the taxes already paid at different stages of value addition. The consumer who buys the product will have to pay only the GST charged by the last dealer in the supply chain, as everyone else would have the opportunity to set-off the taxes paid at the previous stages. If we take the example above under the GST system, the Cenvat on manufacturing the dress and the taxes paid on dyes and buttons can be offset at each level, thereby considerably reducing the total taxes paid.",
