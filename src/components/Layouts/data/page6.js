    "description":"Capital gains are the rising worth of an investment that makes its current value higher than when it was originally bought by the owner. So if you bought shares of a company at Rs. 25 lakh in 2008 and the current value of the shares is Rs. 35 lakh, then the capital gains would be equal to Rs. 10 lakh in 8 years. However, if you do not sell the shares, then the capital gains are not realised and you make no profit. On the other hand, if the worth of the investment has depreciated over a period of time, you incur capital loss if you sell it.",

But this is not applicable to stocks and bonds. Stocks, shares and bonds are faster-moving compared to real estate. Because of this, if they are held for 12 months or less before sale, they fall under short-term capital gains. However, this rule is applicable only to securities which are listed and traded on the stock exchange. If you are trading in unlisted or over-the-counter securities, then the 36-month rule applies.",

Capital gains tax is applicable to any asset that rises in value over time – be it stocks and shares, or a real estate property such as house, land or commercial space.
