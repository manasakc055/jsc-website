                        <p>Taxes are levied by governments on their citizens to generate income for undertaking projects
                            to boost the economy of
                            the country and to raise the standard of living of its citizens. The authority of the
                            government to levy tax in India
                            is derived from the Constitution of India, which allocates the power to levy taxes to the
                            Central and State governments.
                            All taxes levied within India need to be backed by an accompanying law passed by the
                            Parliament or the State Legislature.
                        </p>

                            <h5>Types of Taxes:</h5>
                            <p>Taxes are of two distinct types, direct and indirect taxes. The difference comes in the
                                way these taxes are implemented.
                                Some are paid directly by you, such as the dreaded income tax, wealth tax, corporate tax
                                etc. while others are indirect
                                taxes, such as the value added tax, service tax, sales tax, etc.
                            </p>

                            </ol>
                            <p>But, besides these two conventional taxes, there are also other taxes that have been
                                brought
                                into effect by the Central Government to serve a particular agenda.
                                ‘Other taxes’ are levied on both direct and indirect taxes such as the
                                recently introduced Swachh Bharat Cess tax, Krishi Kalyan Cess tax,
                                and infrastructure Cess tax among others.

                        <h5>1. Direct Tax:</h5>
                        <p>Direct tax, as stated earlier, are taxes that are paid directly by you.
                            These taxes are levied directly on an entity or an individual and cannot be transferred onto
                            anyone else.
                            One of the bodies that overlooks these direct taxes is the <b> Central Board of Direct Taxes
                                (CBDT)</b> which is a part of the Department of Revenue.
                            It has, to help it with its duties, the support of various acts that govern various aspects
                            of direct taxes.
                        </p>
                        <p>Some of these acts are:</p>

                                This is also known as the IT Act of 1961 and sets the rules that govern income tax in
                                India.
                                The income, which this act taxes, can come from any source like a business, owning a
                                house
                                or property, gains received from investments and salaries, etc.
                                This is the act that defines how much the tax benefit on a fixed deposit or a life
                                insurance
                                premium will be.
                                It is also the act that decides how much of your income can you save through investments
                                and
                                what the slab for the income tax will be.

                                The Wealth Tax Act was enacted in 1951 and is responsible for the taxation related to
                                the
                                net
                                wealth of an individual, a company or a Hindu Unified Family.
                                The simplest calculation of wealth tax was that if the net wealth exceeded Rs. 30 lakhs,
                                then 1% of the amount that exceeded Rs. 30 lakhs was payable as tax. It was abolished in
                                the
                                budget announced in 2015.
                                It has since been replaced with a surcharge of 12% on individuals that earn more than
                                Rs.
                                1 crore per annum. It is also applicable to companies that have a revenue of over Rs. 10
                                crores per annum.
                                The new guidelines drastically increased the amount the government would collect in
                                taxes as
                                opposed the amount they would collect through the wealth tax.

                            <p>The Gift Tax Act came into existence in 1958 and stated that if an individual received
                                gifts,
                                monetary or valuables, as gifts, a tax was to be to be paid on such gifts.
                                The tax on such gifts was maintained at 30% but it was abolished in 1998.
                                Initially if a gift was given, and it was something like property, jewellery, shares
                                etc. it
                                was taxable.
                                According to the new rules gifts given by family members like brothers, sister, parents,
                                spouse, aunts and uncles are not taxable.
                                Even gifts given to you by the local authorities is exempt from this tax. How the tax
                                works
                                now is that if someone, other than the exempt entities,
                                gifts you anything that exceeds a value of Rs. 50,000 then the entire gift amount is
                                taxable.

                                It is applicable to all of India except Jammu and Kashmir.
                                It states that certain expenses are chargeable under this act
                                if they exceed Rs. 3,000 in the case of a hotel and all expenses incurred in a

                            It is the tax that is levied on your earning in a financial year. There are many facets to
                            income tax,
                            such as the tax slabs, taxable income, tax deducted at source (TDS), reduction of taxable
                            income, etc.
                            The tax is applicable to both individuals and companies.
                            For individuals, the tax that they have to pay depends on which tax bracket they fall in.
                            This bracket or slab determines the tax to be paid based on the annual income of the
                            assessee and
                            ranges from no tax to 30% tax for the high income groups.

                        <h5>2.Capital Gains Tax:</h5>
                        <p>This is a tax that is payable whenever you receive a sizable amount of money. It could be
                            from an investment or from the sale of a property. It is usually of two types,
                            short term capital gains from investments held for less than 36 months and long term capital
                            gains from investments held for longer than 36 months. The tax applicable for
                            each is also very different since the tax on short term gains is calculated based in the
                            income bracket that you fall in and the tax on long term gains is 20%.
                            The interest thing about this tax is that the gain doesn't always have to be in the form of
                            money.
                            It could also be an exchange in kind in which case the value of the exchange will be
                            considered for taxation.
                        </p>
                        <h5>3. Securities Transaction Tax:</h5>
                        <p>It’s no secret that if you know how to trade properly on the stock market, and trade in
                            securities, you stand to make a substantial amount of money. This too is a source of income
                            but it has its own tax which is known as the Securities Transaction Tax .
                            How this tax is levied is by adding the tax to the price of the share. This means that every
                            time you buy or sell shares, you pay this tax. All securities traded on the Indian stock
                            exchange have this tax attached to them.

                        <h5>4. Perquisite Tax:</h5>
                        <p>Perquisites are all the perks or privileges that employers may extend to employees.
                            These privileges may include a house provided by the company or a car for your use, given to
                            you by the company.
                            These perks are not just limited to big compensation like cars and houses, they can even
                            include things like compensation for fuel or phone bills.
                            How this tax is levied is by figuring out how that perk has been acquired by the company or
                            used by the employee.
                            In the case of cars, it may be so that a car provided by the company and used for both
                            personal and official purposes
                            is eligible for tax whereas a car used only for official purposes is not.

                        <h5>5. Corporate Tax:</h5>
                        <p>Corporate tax is the income tax that is paid by companies from the revenue they earn. This
                            tax also comes with a slab of its own that decides how much tax the company has to pay. For
                            example a domestic company, which has a revenue of less than Rs.
                            1 crore per annum, won’t have to pay this tax but one that has a revenue of more than Rs. 1
                            crore per annum will have to pay this tax. It is also referred to as a surcharge and is
                            different for different revenue brackets.
                            It is also different for international companies where the corporate tax may be 41.2% if the
                            company has a revenue of less than Rs. 10 million and so on.

                        <p>Minimum Alternative Tax, or MAT, is basically a way for the Income Tax Department to get
                            companies to pay a minimum tax,
                            which currently stands at 18.5%. This form of tax was brought into effect through the
                            introduction of Section 115JA of the Income Tax Act.
                            However, companies involved in infrastructure
                            and power sectors are exempt from paying MAT.
                        </p>
                        <p>Once a company pays the MAT, it can carry the payment forward and set-off (adjust) against
                            regular tax payable during the subsequent
                            five-year period subject to certain conditions.

                            In this tax, a number of aspects were covered. Some of them include:

                            FBT was started under the Indian government’s stewardship from April 1, 2005. However,
                            the tax was later scrapped in 2009 by the-then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee during the
                            2009 Union Budget session.

                            based on the dividend they pay to their investors. This tax is applicable on the gross or
                            net income
                            an investor receives from their investment. Currently, the DDT rate stands at 15%.

                            This tax suggested that every bank transaction (debit or credit) would be taxed at a rate of

                        <h5>Indirect Tax:</h5>
                        <p>By definition, indirect taxes are those taxes that are levied on goods or services. They
                            differ from direct taxes because they are not levied on a person who pays them directly to
                            the government, they are instead levied on products and are collected by an intermediary,
                            the person selling the product.
                            The most common examples of indirect tax Indirect tax can be<b> VAT (Value Added Tax), Taxes
                                on Imported Goods, Sales Tax, etc </b>. These taxes are levied by adding them to the
                            price of the service or product which tends to push the cost of the product up.

                            <span>1.Sales Tax:</span>
                            <p>As the name suggests, sales tax is a tax that is levied on the sale of a product.
                                This product can be something that was produced in India or imported and can even cover
                                services rendered.
                                This tax is levied on the seller of the product who then transfers it onto the person
                                who buys said product
                                with the sales tax added to the price of the product. The limitation of this tax is that
                                it can be levied only
                                ones for a particular product, which means that if the product is sold a second time,
                                sales tax cannot be applied to it.
                            </p>
                            <p>Basically, all the states in the country follow their own Sales Tax Act and charge a
                                percentage indigenous to themselves.
                                Besides this, a few states also levy other additional charges like turnover tax,
                                purchase tax, works transaction tax, and the like.
                                This is also the reason why sales tax is one of the largest revenue generators for
                                various state governments.
                                Also, this tax is levied under both central and state legislations.

                            <span>2.Service Tax:</span>
                            <p>Like sales tax is added to the price of goods sold in India,
                                so is service tax added to services provided in India.
                                In the reading of the budget 2015, it was announced that the service tax will be raised
                                from 12.36%
                                to 14%. It is not applicable on goods but on companies that provide services and is
                                collected every
                                month or once every quarter based on how the services are provided. If the establishment
                                is an individual
                                service provider then the service tax is paid only once the customer pays the bills
                                however, for companies
                                the service tax is payable the moment the invoice is raised, irrespective of the
                                customer paying the bill.
                            </p>
                            <p>An important thing to remember is that since the service at a restaurant is a combination
                                of the food, the waiter and the premises themselves,
                                it is difficult to pin point what qualifies for service tax. To remove any ambiguity, in
                                this regard, it has been announced that the service
                                tax in restaurants will be levied only on 40% of the total bill.

                            <p>The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is the largest reform in India’s indirect tax structure

                                started opening up about 25 years ago. The GST is a consumption-based tax, as it is
                                applicable where
                                consumption takes place. The GST is levied on value-added goods and services at each
                                stage of consumption in the supply chain.
                                The GST payable on the procurement of goods and services can be set off against the GST
                                payable on the supply of goods and services,
                                the merchant will pay the applicable GST rate but can claim it back through the tax

                            <p>The value added tax is a tax that is levied at the discretion of the state government and
                                not all states
                                implemented it when it was first announced. The tax is levied on various goods sold in
                                the state and the
                                amount of the tax is decided by the state itself. For example in Gujrat the government
                                split all the good
                                into various categories called schedules. There are 3 schedules and each schedule has
                                its own VAT percentage.
                                For Schedule 3 the VAT is 1%, for schedule 2 the VAT is 5% and so on. Goods that have
                                not been classified into
                                any category have a VAT of 15%.

                            <span>4.Custom duty & Octroi:</span>
                            <p>When you purchase anything that needs to be imported from another country, a charge is
                                applied on it and that
                                is the customs duty. It applies to all the products that come in via land, sea or air.
                                Even if you bring in
                                products bought in another country to India, a customs duty can be levied on it. The
                                purpose of the customs
                                duty is to ensure that all the goods entering the country are taxed and paid for. Just
                                as customs duty ensures
                                that goods for other countries are taxed, octroi is meant to ensure that goods crossing
                                state borders within India are
                                taxed appropriately. It is levied by the state government and functions in much the same
                                way as customs duty does.
                                any category have a VAT of 15%.

                            <p>This is a tax that is levied on all the goods manufactured or produced in India.
                                It is different from customs duty because it is applicable only on things produced
                                in India and is also known as the Central Value Added Tax or CENVAT.
                                This tax is collected by the government from the manufacturer of the goods.
                                It can also be collected from those entities that receive manufactured goods
                                and employ people to transport the goods from the manufacturer to themselves.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Central Excise Rule set by the central government provide suggest
                                that every person that produces or manufactures any 'excisable goods',
                                or who stores such goods in a warehouse, will have to pay the duty
                                applicable on such goods in. Under this rule no excisable goods,
                                on which any duty is payable, will be allowed to move without
                                payment of duty from any place, where they are produced or manufactured.

                        <p>Even though most people are always at odds with the idea of taxation,
                            there are some advantages to taxes, the least of which is that
                            it provides the government the resources it needs for economic development.
                            Some of the other benefits of taxes are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It encourages savings and investments because if a
                                person invests in certain instruments, then the
                                amount invested is reduced from their taxable income
                                thus bringing down the tax they have to pay.
                                This investment is subject to certain limits
                                that are detailed in the IT Act.
                            </li>
                            <li>Paying taxes means that you have to file your tax
                                returns which in turn means that when you apply for
                                a home loan for that home loan, it’s easier to get
                                it because one of the things many banks require is
                                proof that you have been filing taxes regularly.
                            </li>

                        <p>Each type of tax has its own penalties associated with it.
                            These penalties can range from fines to imprisonment depending
                            on the severity of the crime. In some cases the penalty could
                            be that you <b>will have to pay what is owed in taxes along with
